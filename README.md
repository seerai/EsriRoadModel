# Getting DLPK working

Using the road model for North America which can be found 
[here](https://seerai.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=0c00be3c7e4042ebadd3ae1404190a5b).

There is also a global model but it uses TensorFlow so I donâ€™t want to deal with trying to get it running.

In the DLPK there are two scripts `ArcGISImageClassifier.py` and `_road_inference.py`. From what I can tell the first one is just
a wrapper for the second one and since we just want access to the model itself we can just use `_road_inference.py`.

You can initialize and get access to the model with:
```python
from _road_inference.py import ChildImageClassifier

cls = ChildImageClassifier()
cls.initialize(model="path/to/emd", model_as_file=True)
output_tensor, _ = cls.model(input_tensor)
```

## NOTE:
This repo does not contain the `pth` file with the network weights. You must download and unzip the dlpk from the link above
and put it into the `road_model` folder for the docker image to build.
